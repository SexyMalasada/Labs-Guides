# Gen 3 Roamer RNG

This guide is meant to explain & teach you how to RNG Roamer Pokémon in the Gen 3 games, namely the Lati twins in RSE & the three Legendary Beasts in FRLG.<br>
The process is presented here as done on, and with examples in `BizHawk` (which runs an mGBA core); but it can be followed in `mGBA` and `VBA` just as well, with specifics to the latter noted where relevant.
